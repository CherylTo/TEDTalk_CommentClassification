I have actually proposed to the United Nations that an International Peace EVERY Day Treaty For Global Truce and Global Cease Fire be submitted to all nations for them to review and sign. I call for all 192 world leaders to come together in the United Nations on 9/21/12 to sign the treaty. They are invited to raise their right hand and in unison say \"Global Truce Starts Now! Global Cease Fire Starts Now! May Peace Prevail on Earth and Let It Begin With Me! Then all 192 world leaders are invited to simultaneously issue cease fire orders to their military commanders. I am inviting religious, educational and informal leaders to take part also! \n",

I simply appreciate that you have forced us to ask uncomfortable questions. We should know, indeed as a Briton I would like to know, what we are dealing with, what we ask of our soldiers and the effects of their presence on the Iraqi people. Your film tells a vital part of the ongoing story that is not available through the restrictions of reporting a story objectively by even the most even handed news broadcaster. Surely we must have all the information, statistics, perspectives and feelings to really undertake a worthwhile discussion about Iraq and the situation we have found ourselves in? So thank you Ms Scranton. Keep up the good work and be sure to keep the passion that you so obviously carry with you.\n",

We are not merks, jerks maybe but then again all of us can be that in a brief moment of intellectual deficiency.  When we try to do something good and it becomes twisted by those who know not what it means to serve a purpose higher than oneself, we get misunderstood.  We are not callous, just trying to be professional.  We care for children of all nationalities, for they are our future.  I just wish their parents cared for them too.  There are responsibilities on both sides and as a parent I always supervised my kids around moving vehicles.  Deb, can you provide me with a link so I can get my own copy?  I have problems with going into crowds and theaters, but I am working on it.  I have a Vietnam Vet Uncle I want to share this with, we compare our experiences and we agree that when pushed even Ghandi fought, in his own way.  You keep doing what you do and know that your impact is respectfully appreciated for telling a story that is ours and needs to be told.  Remember it is not the critic that matters, it is the one who is in the fray toiling for the successful completion of the assigned task that really matters and is the only one that can make a difference.  You are making a difference and I appreciate your efforts, hang in there and even though a story may not have a happy ending...it still ends.\n",

To kill a person forces me to believe that equality and ethics do not rule over all else. How can any person, in the existance of human kind, truly convince themselves that their life is more valuable than another. As far as modern wars go (the past 50-100 years), each has it's very unique and secretive way for being completely falsified and unjust. I don't hesitate for a moment in saying that any war supporter would reject all forms in the future if they just took some time to figure who profits from war. Who creates the weapons? Who sells the weapons and to how many opposing groups? Where are the real alliances and supposed \"terrorists\"?  \r\n",

Innocent Iraqis are dying every day because of us (myself included).  There is a lot of discussion in this talk about how hard it is to be the invaders, and it comes off as too much self-pity.

      "comment: beautifully said. in my less elegant and more outraged sense, modern compulsory schooling has been a tool of the dominant class to dump the basic training costs of their labor force on the rest of us. schools act like big factories producing obedient and compliant workers (sheep for the slaughter). BlankEmpty slates to be filled in based on industrial needs. They really have no need for artists or dancers or musicians. The question is what are we all willing to do about it? I don't understand how we willingly allow kids to be treated like nothing but just another human \"resource\". I say we fight back and let these bastards that run our schools know, that enough is enough. lets educate our children outside these behavioral laboratories they call schools. get out of kids way and help them find what they want to learn. Help them discover a genuine enthusiasm! DAMN THE MAN! Not for any moral imperative, but don't we all dislike education while under a threat of force or just to get a job?\n",

      "comment: This is one of my all time favorite TED talks. I am both an Artist and an Educator. My brain is constantly on ambidextrous overload with both sides firing off synapses all the time. School and college were the biggest bore to me. I was constantly challenging every thing people taught me to believe and when I finally surrendered I found my self allowing others to manipulate my talents for their own financial gain. We are all unique and it takes an extraordinary gift to first recognize what it is that makes each child special and then be sensitive and wise enough to help bring out their potentials and talents. Education needs to be vast and much more inclusive to new ideas, cultures, technologies, discoveries and techniques so that our children are afforded every opportunity to be all they can be. No one should ever be brought up forced to fit into a mold or box that stunts their imagination or creativity.\n",

      "comment: I think that the speaker has some valid points, for sure, I agree that yes the worlds education system is suffering, and yes the world will probably suffer for today's mistakes later on. I don't agree with everything he says, but he certainly does make some valid points. For example, he speaks of this one particular person who ended up successful and a millionaire because as a child, her mother let the \"shrink\" talk her into becoming a dancer. No as nice as a story like that is, it's not really a good representation of the entire world. If it were, and it happened that way with everyone in the world, then wouldn't everyone be a dancer, or a singer, or a painter? You see I firmly believe in going to school to train for a job you find of interest, but also knowing that there's not some degree out there that guarantees an individual a permanent dancing gig. You know? I'm a singer, I even sell music online sometimes. Does that mean I make that my job? No. It means that I'll continue on with my hobby for most likely the rest of my life, BUT that I'll go to school to acquire a degree that will (only) aid me in finding a job in the next best thing that I find of interest, which is broadcasting/journalism. It's great because I know I'll find work in some sort of way for the public entity, but that I'll also never quit my music. By doing this I don't see myself as giving up on a so called dream. I call this reality.\n",

      "comment: This is definitely one of the best TED talks out there, but I guess I'm a little confused about the argument. Yes, the arts are very important and constantly undermined by our education system, but why would we consider the arts the only way to be creative? He says creativity is the ability to make new ideas that have worth (or something along those lines), and people are doing that everyday through what they learned in school. The top thinkers of our time are generating ideas about cures for diseases and new green technologies and how economies work and so on and so forth. These are the things I'm being taught in school, and the things that someday I can someday be creative about and help society and the world in general. I love music, art, and dance, but the world and humankind doesn't need more musicians or artists, we need to keep discovering how the world around us works and how to use what we can to prosper and evolve.

      "I try  to use terms like \"seem\" and \"appear\" I am not trying to define you I was just pointing out that when questioned on why you would back militant atheism you  seem  to deviate from the talk.  I think I do understand what you're saying as best as anyone could being that you insist on using certain vocabulary then when questioned you give me what  your  definition is for the word in question  (atheism, zealot, indoctrination).  So please forgive me for not knowing ahead of time what your definitions are for words before you mince, no julienne them.  Why you think I should have the exact same opinion as Dawkins boggles my mind \n",
      "Let me remind you.  My initial point was that the presenter was no different than any grandstanding religious fundamentalist and who's talk was more bravado than substance.  You defended his point citing that   It helps nothing to call the laws God, but neither does it hurt anyone .  Since then I have tried to illustrate that it does help to seek common ground between the two factions as  they both have good information to share. \n",
      "Lastly , about me trying to define what you think.  Let me remind you of your comments.  To be fair, this view is commonly referred to as Pantheism, or Einsteinian religion .  You see I am secure in where I am philosophically right now.  So I did not feel the need to protest the attempt to label me, I just let it slide off.\n",

      "1.  I didn't say atheism was new.  I said that outspoken atheism is a reactionary viewpoint.  The only requirement for one to be an atheist is that you do not believe in God.  If nobody else did either, the word 'atheist' needn't ever be uttered.  Don't patronise me by trying to give me a lesson about Socrates.   Also, why did you put the words \"enlightened\" and \"original\" in quotation marks?  I never said them. \r\n",
      "2.  Would the 9/11 hijackers have flown those planes into the WTC  if  they did not believe they would be posthumously rewarded?  Perhaps, but it must have made it much easier for them to do it.  Irrational beliefs affect us all, whether or not we are the ones that hold them. \r\n",
      "3.  Kindly elaborate on your assertion that I treat Dawkins as a 'God'.  Isn't it a little presumptive to claim that I worship him? \r\n",
      "4.  You seem to be mistaking me for someone who thinks he has all the answers.  I don't know what caused the big bang.  I don't know beyond doubt that the big bang happened.  I can't know.  I have a problem with those who claim they do.  Again, you're attacking a straw man. \r\n",
      "5.  I ask the question again: does religion (true or false) affect our daily life, or doesn't it?\n",

      "What is going to happen when those with stronger authoritarian drives (perhaps the majority by many accounts) are threatened by the decline of authoritarian culture (or old fashioned attitudes) and the growing power of progressive liberal culture? It could result in significant social breakdown, violence, and a lot of suffering. \r\n",
      "Those who are not authoritarian will have to find a way to help authoritarians heal the deep scars that got them there in the first place - to help them grow beyond simple childhood attitudes, and to understand the meaning of 'the sins of the fathers shall be visited on the sons', and to understand the true meaning of Love. [...] we should not be talking of waging a war against those who crave authoritarian leadership but of making peace and Love with them. http://usofc.wordpress.com/2009/04/12/authoritarianism-culture-and-mind/\n",

      "Can you  really  not see how pattern is not intelligence?  Then your argument is a strange, watered-down Intelligent Design. \r\n",
      "All you have said so far is that \"there is a pattern\", that this somehow constitutes intelligence, and that you are justified in equating 'order' with 'God'.  Why would you use such a loaded, personal term for something you do not think is personal?  I maintain that this is nothing but metaphor.  Your belief does not make any claim about reality, just about the impression it gives you.  If you are only stating your impression of natural order and not making a claim about its origin, then there is no right or wrong answer.  But this is not religion, nor is it spirituality.  It's just poetry - like when I describe myself as an island without claiming to actually be one.  Poetry is not what we're discussing - we're talking about what  is .\n",

      "comment: Many references below to harm done by religion, (more accurate to say some religions, not all), certainly no argument there. In all due respect isn't it true that science has also been responsible for things like - the atomic bomb, the nuclear bomb, harmful drugs and chemicals (which our world is now swimming in)  that are ruining the environment and causing cancer etc. Governments of all forms have done harm from the beginning of history through to today. What's the common denominator here? People. People often acting out of unconsciousness, lack of foresight, fear, greed, \n",
      "Perhaps it is not whether someone believes in God, is agnostic or atheist that we should care so deeply about. I am far less concerned about whether evolution and intelligent design are taught in the schools as I am about whether children/we are learning things like - conflict resolution, tolerance, non-violence, compassion, consideration of the affects of and responsibility for one's actions.\n",

      "comment: Jose, I'm sorry, but I must take you up on three points \n",
      "1. Why call the natural laws God?  \n",
      "The point here is that the natural laws can be called the Natural laws. If a person calls himself a believer, but his God is nothing but the natural laws, then his view does not differ from that of the humanist. He simply uses a different word to describe it. The disagreement is semantic.  \n",
      "2. People who believe are inferior or stupid.  \n",
      "    A priori, this is false. Intellectual capacity and religious belief are not mutually exclusive. With this being said, religion DOES appeal in particular to the poor, uneducated and the unfortunate. This is observable, quantifiable fact based on research and data. Furthermore, the probability of being a religious believer goes down significantly among individuals as the education level goes up. This is what Dawkins is saying here and again, this is backed by the data. To say that I or Dawkins think religious people are by definition stupid IS divisive and it grossly misrepresents the argument made.  \n",
      "3. Religion has been destructive and caused great misery. \n",
      "    Well, I don't know about other non religious people, but I wouldn't back away from that claim although I would want to nuance it a bit. Religious belief has many good things going for it. But it would be ludicrous to suggest that religion has NOT caused misery. Moreover, it has done so based on propositions which are often manifestly false. (Sure AIDS is bad, but Condoms are much worse).  \n",
      "   As you say, we can't disprove there is a God. The point of secularism or humanism is that since no one could possibly know these things, it is ludicrous to base our lives on religious doctrine. We must organize our societies on facts that we CAN verify. \n",
      "       I'll close by saying if you perceive 'Atheism' as a belief system, you are simply mistaken. Atheism implies that one should base his life on what he knows, not on what he doesn't.\n",

      "comment: I very much enjoyed this talk and find Dawkins to be engaging and very insightful. I am an atheist myself (although I only started calling myself one after inspiration from Dawkins; I'd hesitated beforehand because I couldn't say with certainty that there is no god) so I suppose it's natural I would like this talk. \n",
      "However, there is something that bugs me about Dawkins' approach. There is something about his style that I fear will only anger theists and have the opposite effect. But maybe his goal is preaching to the choir to encourage atheists to take a stand....Atheism is not a religion or way of life, but he talks as if he is defending one - with conviction and condescension that is sure to wound a theist's pride. I cannot think of a better approach to encourage rationality over superstition (that is the point of his mission, right?), since a direct challenge to one's deeply held beliefs is sure to arouse anger and defense. \n",
      "I work with devout Mormons in a town that is 95% Mormon. I think their beliefs are completely nonsensical and bizarre, but the people themselves are very kind and respectable. We have had many conversations about religion and I know that, were I to \"stop being so damn respectable,\" the conversation would cease and they would no longer be open and honest with me. I also feel it is impossible to change their minds. Many of them admit there is no way to prove that God exists except to feel it. How does one respond to that? \n",
      "Anyway, as I said I do not know a better way to expose the absurdity of religion, but I do believe it is a worthy mission for the sole reason of encouraging rationality, logic and skepticism. So I am glad that Dawkins has sparked such a debate; he has the best mind for it, but his style will not convert most theists. Furthermore, atheists with the character to attack the absurdity of religion head-on are most likely the type to do so carelessly and without tact, for the sole purpose of proving their point.\n",

      "comment: Ok...in religious circles (I'm a Christian) I can see why individuals may denigrate one another, though I don't espouse this. If they take that whole 144,000 thing in the Bible literally...well hell...they're jockeying for \"seats\" in Heaven. What I don't understand is for what position atheists are jockeying. The idea that atheists are in a place, by virtue of their non-belief, to judge those of us who are of  a faith as inferior intellectually and morally is right on par with the judgmental stance that the faithful (especially Christians) are said to possess. Science and faith are not mutually exclusive to all of us. Religion is not the anti-intellectual to all of us.  Many of us (a vastly growing number) are becoming more tolerant and accepting in disposition, ecumenical in philosophy, and more interdisciplinary in approach. When those of us who are willing to have the tough, rational, but civil conversations are around, where are these militant atheists? It seems that the most outspoken among them are cynical, condescending, and call for others to share these traits. Moreover, atheists speak of this group monolithically. A relationship with any deity is intensely personal. No one thing can be said of all Christians...not even the belief in Christ (I know a Pentecostal...another story). My personal trek has taken me through Buddhism, agnosticism, Jewish mysticism, and back...and my personal theology has been altered and greatly influenced by all these. I feel like I'm a better man of faith for my various studies and experiences. Men like Dawkins and Hitchens are insanely intelligent, and have a lot to say, but aren't so great at listening. It's easy to compile examples of the inane to use against the faithful...it's much harder to sit down and reason with a woman/man of faith that is rational and equally intelligent, but that exchange is the more beautiful interaction. We've enough warring factions. Answers are not so important as the questions...and the journey.\n",

      "I think Richard Dawkins is a very intelligent man, and I appreciated some of his jokes.  Unfortunately, many of his jokes and jabs were at a distortion of Christianity that I don't (but unfortunately a large majority does) partake in.  Certainly there are a lot of flaws with close-minded ultra-conservatives who use religion as a political weapon, but they do not represent God nor those of us actually trying down here.  So please, Richard Dawkins, and other TED speakers, when trying to fight back against the bigotry of the political right, please don't steep yourself in the bigotry of using the (unfortunate) norms of Christianity to stereotype the actual meanings or individual believers. \n",
      "As a side note, I believe in evolution, love science, and have always been encouraged by religious leaders to question my faith at every opportunity.  I don't think Jesus would have endorsed Bush, or Obama, or Clinton, or Gore, or Reagan. I don't think One Nation Under God is exclusive to other nations.  Dawkins asserts the burden of proof is on the believer.  I would agree and say the burden is even more so on the proclaim-er, because I'm not the one on a stage in front of hundred (and a website in front of millions) telling everyone it is right to BELIEVE there is no God.  If you're going to sell it to me, Dawkins, show me how it works first.  That's a big unanswered question in my book.\n",
